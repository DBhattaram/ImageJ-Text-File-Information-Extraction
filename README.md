# ImageJ-Text-File-Information-Extraction
This code was created for the purpose of combing through an entire folder of .txt files generated by ImageJ analysis. It reads each file and can extract as many rows or columns of data as needed. The program need only be placed in the same folder as the .txt files for it to do its work.
The program currently finds and compiles the ranges of a particular column in each Gaussian fit .txt file, while also filtering out values that are abnormally large and notifying the user of which files were filtered out and by what margin.
